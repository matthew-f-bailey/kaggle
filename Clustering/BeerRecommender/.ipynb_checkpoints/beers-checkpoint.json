Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage.

Arctic Devil Barley Wine","description":"Notes:Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released.In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate.

You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau.The traditional symbol for bock beers of all varieties is the billy goat. This is the reason that Free State named this Maibock after Dr. John R. Brinkley, a.k.a. \"The Goat Gland Doctor.\" In 1920s Kansas, Brinkley gained notoriety for his alleged cure for infertility that involved the surgical implantation of goat glands in the affected individuals.

This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops \u2013 fresh from the fields \u2013 as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils.To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish.

Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin?

The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called \u2018Trappist\u2019. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles.

Hand-crafted by Ron Jeffries at his Jolly Pumpkin Brewery in Dexter, which is consistantly rated as one of one of the best in the world, all of the Leelanau Brewing Company beers are distingushed by their time spent in a large French oak barrique prior to bottling and re-fermentation. The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don\u2019t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste. The slightly malty, fruity body quickly transitions effortlessly to a crisp, dry and somewhat tart finish.

Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment.

This beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate. Tremendous amounts of American hops will creep up on you, and leave you with a dense hoppy finish in you mouth. So drinkable, it's scary. Sometimes I wish I could crawl right into the can.Freshness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have work so hard to retain.If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom -- leave them in the can while pouring. This beer is perishable, and at its best when it is young, fresh and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately, we are always making more. -- John Kimmich75 IBU\\t","abv":8.0,"min_ibu":50,"max_ibu":70,"astringency":16,"body":42,"alcohol":18,"bitter":91,"sweet":40,"sour":55,"salty":0,"fruits":76,"hoppy":117,"spices":2,"malty":30,"review_aroma":4.660981,"review_appearance":4.163113,"review_palate":4.405117,"review_taste":4.608742,"review_overall":4.6258,"number_of_reviews":469,"cluster":3},{"name":"Abner","style":"IPA - New England","brewery":"Hill Farmstead Brewery","full_name":"Hill Farmstead Brewery Abner Imperial IPA","description":"Notes:Abner (1867-1953) is our great grandfather; Hill Farmstead Brewery rests upon the land that was once home to him and his fourteen children.

Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category.

It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent.

This guarantees flour of a very high quality, from a totally natural environment.Highly fermentable, chestnut flour has an excellent impact on the quality of the head and gives beer its beautiful coloring. Mixed into the malt during the mashing process, the chestnut flour is a prime ingredient and not just a flavoring.This recipe, unique in the world, gives PIETRA its conflicting taste accentuating a lingering subtle bitterness.Powerful and delicate, robust and smooth, Pietra has a 6% alcohol content. It displays a beautiful amber color, an intense chestnut head, dense and creamy, making the pleasure of tasting it all the more enjoyable.\\t","abv":6.0,"min_ibu":15,"max_ibu":30,"astringency":25,"body":28,"alcohol":18,"bitter":26,"sweet":51,"sour":19,"salty":0,"fruits":9,"hoppy":57,"spices":5,"malty":126,"review_aroma":3.416667,"review_appearance":3.5,"review_palate":3.458333,"review_taste":3.583333,"review_overall":3.541667,"number_of_reviews":12,"cluster":7},{"name":"Mac Queen's Nessie","style":"Lager - Vienna","brewery":"Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg","full_name":"Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg Mac Queen's Nessie","description":"Notes:Note: New recipe from 2008, gravity went down from 16\u00b0 to 12\u00b0, alcohol from 7.3% to 5%\\t","abv":5.0,"min_ibu":15,"max_ibu":30,"astringency":16,"body":45,"alcohol":46,"bitter":28,"sweet":66,"sour":32,"salty":2,"fruits":30,"hoppy":44,"spices":21,"malty":113,"review_aroma":3.252577,"review_appearance":3.319588,"review_palate":3.319588,"review_taste":3.237113,"review_overall":3.293814,"number_of_reviews":97,"cluster":7},{"name":"Wild Hop Organic Amber LagerGreen Valley Brewing Company (Crooked Creek)","style":"Lager - Vienna","brewery":"Green Valley Brewing Company (Crooked Creek)","full_name":"Green Valley Brewing Company (Crooked Creek) Wild Hop Organic Amber Lager","description":"Notes:","abv":0.0,"min_ibu":15,"max_ibu":30,"astringency":24,"body":40,"alcohol":8,"bitter":48,"sweet":34,"sour":20,"salty":0,"fruits":12,"hoppy":63,"spices":4,"malty":58,"review_aroma":3.014493,"review_appearance":3.315217,"review_palate":3.057971,"review_taste":3.039855,"review_overall":3.228261,"number_of_reviews":138,"cluster":14},{"name":"Oktoberfest","style":"Lager - Vienna","brewery":"Hinterland Brewery Restaurant","full_name":"Hinterland Brewery Restaurant Oktoberfest","description":"Notes:Joe, our Brew Master, went to Munich for a few days of inspiration for this Vienna style beer.

Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuv\u00e9e Ren\u00e9, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU\\t","abv":3.5,"min_ibu":15,"max_ibu":21,"astringency":22,"body":28,"alcohol":10,"bitter":3,"sweet":87,"sour":89,"salty":0,"fruits":102,"hoppy":7,"spices":9,"malty":13,"review_aroma":3.920382,"review_appearance":4.031847,"review_palate":3.847134,"review_taste":3.915074,"review_overall":3.83758,"number_of_reviews":471,"cluster":18},{"name":"Oude Kriek","style":"Lambic - Fruit","brewery":"Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen","full_name":"Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek","description":"Notes:3 Fonteinen Oude Kriek is the result of macerating hand-picked whole sour cherries on young lambic for at least four months, in a proportion of one kilogram of fruit per litre of lambic.

This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuv\u00e9e Ren\u00e9.\\t","abv":5.0,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":31,"body":32,"alcohol":7,"bitter":8,"sweet":131,"sour":183,"salty":0,"fruits":97,"hoppy":24,"spices":3,"malty":24,"review_aroma":3.640805,"review_appearance":3.747126,"review_palate":3.635057,"review_taste":3.617816,"review_overall":3.649425,"number_of_reviews":174,"cluster":18},{"name":"Mort Subite Gueuze","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"Brouwerij Mort Subite","full_name":"Brouwerij Mort Subite Mort Subite Gueuze","description":"Notes:","abv":4.5,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":12,"body":20,"alcohol":6,"bitter":3,"sweet":86,"sour":95,"salty":0,"fruits":60,"hoppy":9,"spices":5,"malty":14,"review_aroma":3.5,"review_appearance":3.745455,"review_palate":3.409091,"review_taste":3.363636,"review_overall":3.527273,"number_of_reviews":110,"cluster":11},{"name":"Oude Geuze De Cam","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"De Cam Geuzestekerij","full_name":"De Cam Geuzestekerij Oude Geuze De Cam","description":"Notes:","abv":5.5,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":63,"body":55,"alcohol":9,"bitter":11,"sweet":62,"sour":229,"salty":1,"fruits":115,"hoppy":38,"spices":10,"malty":19,"review_aroma":4.276786,"review_appearance":4.142857,"review_palate":4.133929,"review_taste":4.401786,"review_overall":4.3125,"number_of_reviews":56,"cluster":18},{"name":"Belle Vue Gueuze","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"Brasserie Belle-Vue","full_name":"Brasserie Belle-Vue Belle Vue Gueuze","description":"Notes:","abv":5.5,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":23,"body":38,"alcohol":4,"bitter":10,"sweet":91,"sour":101,"salty":3,"fruits":44,"hoppy":18,"spices":4,"malty":41,"review_aroma":3.146341,"review_appearance":3.390244,"review_palate":3.195122,"review_taste":2.963415,"review_overall":3.170732,"number_of_reviews":41,"cluster":11},{"name":"De Troch Oude Gueuze","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"Brouwerij De Troch","full_name":"Brouwerij De Troch De Troch Gueuze","description":"Notes:","abv":5.5,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":51,"body":23,"alcohol":5,"bitter":14,"sweet":49,"sour":200,"salty":7,"fruits":96,"hoppy":8,"spices":14,"malty":30,"review_aroma":4.75,"review_appearance":4.25,"review_palate":4.25,"review_taste":4.75,"review_overall":4.75,"number_of_reviews":2,"cluster":18},{"name":"Girardin Gueuze 1882 (White Label)","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"Brouwerij Girardin","full_name":"Brouwerij Girardin Girardin Gueuze 1882 (White Label)","description":"Notes:Filtered version.\\t","abv":5.0,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":34,"body":30,"alcohol":4,"bitter":14,"sweet":83,"sour":163,"salty":0,"fruits":88,"hoppy":27,"spices":14,"malty":18,"review_aroma":3.870968,"review_appearance":4.016129,"review_palate":3.967742,"review_taste":4.016129,"review_overall":4.0,"number_of_reviews":31,"cluster":18},{"name":"Brabantiae","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"Brasserie Cantillon","full_name":"Brasserie Cantillon Cantillon Brabantiae","description":"Notes:Brabantiae is a gueuze that was finished in Port wine barrels.\\t","abv":5.0,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":42,"body":36,"alcohol":5,"bitter":18,"sweet":29,"sour":169,"salty":0,"fruits":80,"hoppy":11,"spices":2,"malty":7,"review_aroma":4.095238,"review_appearance":4.095238,"review_palate":4.214286,"review_taste":4.309524,"review_overall":4.166667,"number_of_reviews":21,"cluster":18},{"name":"Mort Subite Oude Gueuze","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"Brouwerij Mort Subite","full_name":"Brouwerij Mort Subite Mort Subite Oude Gueuze","description":"Notes:","abv":7.0,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":26,"body":38,"alcohol":10,"bitter":9,"sweet":82,"sour":159,"salty":1,"fruits":92,"hoppy":6,"spices":7,"malty":33,"review_aroma":3.769231,"review_appearance":3.884615,"review_palate":3.769231,"review_taste":3.846154,"review_overall":3.653846,"number_of_reviews":13,"cluster":18},{"name":"Reuss","style":"Lambic - Gueuze","brewery":"Brouwerij Kerkom","full_name":"Brouwerij Kerkom Reuss","description":"Notes:Reuss is produced for the Bink festival.

The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called \"cold hopping\", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.\\t","abv":6.5,"min_ibu":0,"max_ibu":10,"astringency":69,"body":34,"alcohol":16,"bitter":90,"sweet":59,"sour":191,"salty":4,"fruits":123,"hoppy":100,"spices":17,"malty":56,"review_aroma":4.197832,"review_appearance":4.039295,"review_palate":4.123306,"review_taste":4.226287,"review_overall":4.093496,"number_of_reviews":369,"cluster":18},{"name":"Bruocsella (1900) Grand Cru","style":"Lambic -

German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness.

Our unique Three Philosophers Quardupel Ale is universally-known as the preferred elixir of life\u2019s meditators, thinkers and theorizers. Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life\u2019s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply. \u201cWe\u2019ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,\u201d said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. \u201cThree Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We\u2019re sure this\u2019ll be a crowd pleaser.\u201dLike the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry. The body is ample but still finishes faintly dry with lingering hints of malt, bourbon, and cherry.

This with the intention of becoming a more constant taste of the \"real cherry beer\" over the years.\\t","abv":6.8,"min_ibu":10,"max_ibu":25,"astringency":37,"body":26,"alcohol":7,"bitter":2,"sweet":91,"sour":140,"salty":0,"fruits":131,"hoppy":13,"spices":13,"malty":28,"review_aroma":3.850543,"review_appearance":3.904891,"review_palate":3.714674,"review_taste":3.828804,"review_overall":3.790761,"number_of_reviews":184,"cluster":18},{"name":"Zoetzuur Flemish AleDe Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot)","style":"Sour - Flanders Red Ale","brewery":"De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot)","full_name":"De Proefbrouwerij (bvba Andelot) Zoetzuur Flemish Ale","description":"Notes:","abv":7.0,"min_ibu":10,"max_ibu":25,"astringency":37,"body":58,"alcohol":7,"bitter":3,"sweet":116,"sour":156,"salty":0,"fruits":130,"hoppy":15,"spices":22,"malty":39,"review_aroma":4.087879,"review_appearance":4.060606,"review_palate":3.930303,"review_taste":3.987879,"review_overall":3.987879,"number_of_reviews":165,"cluster":18},{"name":"Michael","style":"Sour - Flanders Red Ale","brewery":"Hair of the Dog Brewing Company \/ Brewery and Tasting Room","full_name":"Hair of the Dog Brewing Company \/ Brewery and Tasting Room Michael","description":"Notes:Michael is a Flanders Red, made in memory of Michael Jackson.

In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England. This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon \"Russian Imperial Stout\" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer\u2019s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it\u2019s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known.

Perhaps UFO\u2019s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast\u2019s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish.

It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States.

This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel.

The amount of cilantro was nearly quadrupled with 4 lbs total, which was pureed with a portion of the cider and then added after the boil was done. The cayenne was doubled, but added directly before the beer was transferred from the kettle to the fermenter in an effort to minimize the burn while increasing the flavor and aroma contributed. A different type of wit yeast was used and then fermented slightly cooler to keep the yeast character minimal and act as a supporting role to the main players the cider and spices.
